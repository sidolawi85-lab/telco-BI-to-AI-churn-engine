# Telco BI → AI Churn Engine
### Turning churn insights into autonomous AI actions that protect recurring revenue

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the transition from **traditional Business Intelligence (BI)** to a **production-ready AI-driven churn prevention system** for a telecommunications provider.

Instead of stopping at dashboards and insights, the project operationalizes analytics into **automated decision-making workflows** that proactively retain customers, stabilize Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR), and reduce manual customer success effort.

---

## 📊 Executive Summary

- **Overall Churn Rate:** 26.5%
- **Key Risk Patterns Identified:**
  - Early-stage **6-Month Churn Cliff**
  - High churn concentration among **Month-to-Month contracts**
  - **High-ARPU Fiber Optic customers** with a 66% churn risk

The system converts these insights into **AI-powered automations** that intervene before churn occurs.

## 🔍 Business Problems & AI Solutions

### 1️⃣ Early-Stage “Churn Cliff”

**Problem**  
A sharp spike in cancellations occurs within the first six months of the customer lifecycle, driven by poor onboarding and weak value realization.

**AI Solution — Customer Lifecycle Retention System**
- Classifies customers into *Onboarding* and *Value Discovery* phases
- Automatically triggers lifecycle-specific educational and value reinforcement messages

**Business Impact**
- Improves customer activation
- Reduces avoidable early churn
- Scales retention without increasing manual workload

---

### 2️⃣ Month-to-Month Contract Vulnerability

**Problem**  
Month-to-Month subscribers represent the highest churn risk, creating unstable MRR.

**AI Solution — Contract Stability Engine**
- Segments customers into **Gold / Silver / Bronze** tiers using spend and loyalty logic
- Uses generative AI to deliver personalized, non-aggressive upgrade offers
- Incentivizes long-term commitments through price locks and tailored benefits

**Business Impact**
- Protects an estimated **15–20% of MRR**
- Replaces thousands of manual outreach actions with automated workflows
- Converts passive users into committed customers

---

### 3️⃣ High-Value Fiber Optic Churn

**Problem**  
Fiber Optic customers generate the highest ARPU yet show a **66% churn risk**, indicating service quality and experience gaps.

**AI Solution — Fiber Experience Sentinel**
- Detects *silent churners* before complaints are raised
- Segments users by tenure and satisfaction score
- Triggers proactive diagnostics or white-glove escalation

**Business Impact**
- Reduces manual Customer Success workload by **~80%**
- Prevents high-value revenue loss before customers defect
- Improves perceived service quality for premium users

## 🧠 System Architecture (Conceptual)

1. **BI Layer**
   - SQL-based churn analysis
   - Customer segmentation & risk scoring
2. **Decision Logic Layer**
   - JavaScript rules for eligibility, prioritization, and tiering
3. **AI Layer**
   - Gemini AI for personalized communication and action recommendations
4. **Automation Layer**
   - Orchestrated workflows triggering emails, diagnostics, and escalations

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- SQL & BI Dashboards
- JavaScript (Automation Logic)
- Gemini AI (Generative Decision Support)
- Workflow Automation (n8n-style orchestration)
- Markdown-based documentation for reproducibility

## 🎯 Why This Project Matters

Most BI projects stop at **insight delivery**.  
This project demonstrates how analytics can be **directly embedded into AI systems** that:

- Act autonomously
- Scale decision-making
- Protect revenue in real time

It reflects a shift from **reporting → execution**.
