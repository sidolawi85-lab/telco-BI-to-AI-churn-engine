# Customer Lifecycle Retention System

## Purpose
Reduce early-stage churn by proactively supporting customers during the most fragile period of the lifecycle (0–6 months).

---

## Trigger Conditions
- New customer created OR
- Daily scan of active customers with tenure ≤ 180 days

---

## Core Logic
1. Calculate customer tenure in days
2. Assign lifecycle phase:
   - **Onboarding:** 0–90 days
   - **Value Discovery:** 91–180 days
3. Exclude customers with:
   - Open support tickets
   - Recent retention interaction (<14 days)

## AI Actions
- Generate phase-specific messaging using Gemini AI:
  - Onboarding: feature education, setup tips, activation nudges
  - Value Discovery: use-case reinforcement, value realization examples

---

## Automation Outputs
- Personalized lifecycle email
- Optional SMS or in-app notification
- Interaction logged for future suppression logic

## Business Impact
- Increases early activation rates
- Reduces avoidable churn during the 6-month “churn cliff”
- Scales customer success without additional headcount
